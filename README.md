# HaxeSnake

The purpose of this project is to explore what [Haxe] and its high performance library, [Heaps], have to offer for game development.

Snake was chosen as it is a common game with an established design. This means that all of the effort will go into developing a method of designing the model to be used for future projects.

# Target Platforms

So far I've been able to test the application for JavaScript and Flash. As [Heaps] is still in development I have not found a way to compile it for desktop (C++). [Electron] can fill that gap and it works well.
